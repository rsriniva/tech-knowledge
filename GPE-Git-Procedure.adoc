== Procedure to create FSW project

== Create a Git Repository on RedHat Server

1) Connect to file.rdu.edhat.server using your RedHat Kerberos id

  ssh redHatKerberosId@file.rdu.redhat.com  

where redHatKErberosIs should be your RedHat username

2) Move to directory of middleware partners team  

  cd /mnt/share/PartnerTraining/mw 

3) Create a Git Repo under this directory

  git init --shared=group --bare ‘project’

where ‘project’ corresponds to the code name of the training project (camel, fsw, hyla, …)

Remarks :

“--shared=group" sets the file permissions up for sharing with the
group.

"--bare" sets the repository up to be in a server role, with no local
working copy

== Clone the project created at step 3) on your machine

1) Open a Terminal on your Machine and move to the directory where you would like to manage your training project

  Example  : cd ~/GPE/Trainings

2) Clone the project

  git clone redHatKerberosId@file.rdu.redhat.com:/mnt/share/PartnerTraining/mw/’project’

where ‘project’ corresponds to the code name of the training project (camel, fsw, hyla, …)

3) Add a README.md file to the new ‘empty’ project cloned and commit/push modification

  cd fsw
  touch README.md
  echo ‘GPE FSW Training’ > README.md

4) Commit modification and push it

  git commit -m “Upload README.md file” -a
  git push

Remark : The server will prompt you and will ask you about your password
